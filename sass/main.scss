SASS

- CSS pre-processor 
- allows for variables, nesting, operators, partials/imports, mixins, functions, extensions, control directives (not covered here)
- Sass vs SCSS - two different syntaxes for SASS. Sass isn't indent-dependent and doesn't require semicolons/curly braces; kinda confusing
    - SCSS is preferred, looks more like original CSS

- variables:        
    - starts with a $

- color functions - can darken a color instead of manually selecting a darker color

- TO INSTALL, first install Node and then:
    make sure python and Desktop dev with C++ workload for Visual Studio are installed
    "npm init" in command line to create package.json file
    "npm install node-sass --save-dev" to specify as dev dependency

- If receiving a project with only package.json file but no node_modules folder,
    just run the "npm install" command, which will go through package.json and download
    the appropriate versions of things

- To actuall use SASS:
    - Create folder to put SASS files in
    - Create SASS files and do some SASS coding
    - In package.json in "scripts", include "compile:sass": "node-sass sass/main.scss css/style.css"
    - In command prompt, run "npm run compile:sass"
    - To keep from having to rerun npm run compile:sass, add the -w (watch) flag
        - "npm run compile:sass -w"
        - this means that if you close the terminal, it will stop watching :(

/*
BOX TYPES

Block-level boxes (display:block)       elements formatted visually as blocks
                                        100% of parent's width
                                        vertically, one after another
                                        box-model applies

Inline boxes (display:inline)           content is distributed in lines
                                        occupies only content's space
                                        no linebreaks
                                        no heights or widths
                                        paddings and margins only apply on left and right (!?)

Inline-block (display: inline-block)    mix of block and inline
                                        occupies only content's space
                                        no line-breaks
                                        box-model applies

POSITIONING SCHEMES

Normal Flow                             default positioning
                                        not floated
                                        not absolutely positioned
                                        elements laid out according to source order

Floats                                  element is removed from the normal flow
                                        text and inline elements will wrap around the floated element
                                        container will not adjust its height to the element (use clear fixes to fix)

Absolute Positioning                    element is removed from the normal flow
                                        no impact on surrounding content or elements
                                        use top, bottom, left, and right to offset the element from its relatively positioned center

/*
STACKING CONTEXTS

z-index                                 highest z-index appears on top
however, other things also affect stacking context -- opacity, transform, filter, etc.
